# Introduction

Welcome to the Bestow Quote API. Users of the API can get price quotes for Bestow life insurance products by passing in a few customer parameters.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell

curl -X POST \
  https://api.hellobestow.com/v2/quote \
  -H 'Authorization: 82zZIHeBqUlBtICMX5li' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
```

> Make sure to replace `82zZIHeBqUlBtICMX5li` with your API key.

Bestow uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Bestow API key by sending an [email to us](mailto:jake@bestow.co).

Bestow expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: 82zZIHeBqUlBtICMX5li`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>82zZIHeBqUlBtICMX5li</code> with your personal API key.

# Quote

## Creating a Quote

Every insurance policy begins with a quote. You can think of quotes as templates that eventually turn into policies if a user decides to buy. Quotes are used to indicate the terms of the policy and the price (premium) associated with it.

When calculating policy prices, we take many attributes into consideration, such as the user's age, gender, height, weight and status. You’ll need to include this information when creating a quote through the API.

> To get a quote, use this code:

```shell

curl -X POST \
  https://api.hellobestow.com/v2/quote \
  -H 'Authorization: 82zZIHeBqUlBtICMX5li' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -d '{
	"birth_date": "1980-01-01",
	"gender": "male",
	"height_feet": 6,
	"height_inches": 0,
	"state": "TX",
	"weight": 180,
  "tobacco": "no"
}
'
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:
